C++ port of the entity-component library Artemis.

Credit goes to Arni Arent the original author and Vladimir Ivanov (ArCorvus) the porter.

Found this some time ago and modified it slightly. Storing it for later use.

Codeblocks projects create libraries, and the sample project is a random terminal program that came with the original code.
